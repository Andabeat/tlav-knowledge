**Accountability:** The expectation and practice that both individuals and institutions must answer for their actions and accept consequences for harm or rule-breaking.

**Acephalous societies:** Societies with no single governing head or centralized leadership, where power and decision-making are shared across families or groups and usually organized through consensus.

**Agents of socialization:** The individuals, groups, and institutions that teach and reinforce norms, values, skills, and identities. Major agents include family, peers, schools, media, religious communities, workplaces, and other organizations.

**Ancestor Consciousness:** Paying attention to the presence and stories of those who came before us.

**Assisted reproductive technologies (ART):** Medical techniques such as in vitro fertilization, sperm or egg donation, and surrogacy that help people conceive. ART reshapes ideas of parenthood, kinship, and the body.

**Autonomy:** The capacity of individuals or groups to make decisions and act according to their own values and judgments within the limits set by collective norms.

**Backfire effect:** A reaction in which attempts to correct false beliefs strengthen those beliefs instead, because new information clashes with an existing mental framework.

**Bands and tribes:** Categories of small-scale political organization characterized by relatively low population density and limited formal bureaucracy. Bands typically rely on kinship and consensus, while tribes add more enduring leadership roles and larger, more settled communities.

**Biological continuity:** The maintenance of a population over time through fertility, birth, and child survival. It connects individual reproductive choices with long-term demographic patterns.

**Biological reproduction:** The processes through which humans conceive and bear children, ensuring the continuation of a population. It links bodies, fertility practices, and kinship recognition.

**Care work:** The activities involved in meeting the physical, emotional, and social needs of others, such as children, elders, and dependents. It often occurs in households and remains undervalued or unpaid.

**Caregiving:** The direct provision of support, supervision, and assistance to dependents or vulnerable people. It is central to social reproduction and frequently feminized.

**Centralized collection:** The process by which a central authority such as a chief, council, religious body, or state agency gathers resources from members of a group. This collection rests on shared norms of obligation, trust, and legitimacy.

**Child-rearing:** The practices and responsibilities involved in caring for and educating children from infancy to adulthood. It prepares new members of society to participate in social, economic, and cultural life.

**Cinematic qualia:** Great films evoke visceral, sensory feelings, blending the perception of real experiences with emotional and physical realism.

**Civic understanding:** A baseline grasp of how public institutions and processes work that allows people to participate in collective decisions and respond to civic events.

**Class inequalities:** Systematic differences in wealth, power, and life chances based on socio-economic position. They heavily influence reproductive options, family planning, and child well-being.

**Cognitive anthropology:** An interdisciplinary approach that studies how thinking, perception, and memory always take shape within specific cultural worlds. It investigates how shared mental frameworks link individual minds into collective ways of knowing and acting.

**Cognitive orientation:** Shared ways of perceiving, interpreting, and making sense of the world that emerge from daily practice, environment, and social organization.

**Collaborative problem-solving:** A joint process in which people build a shared definition of a problem and explore solutions together rather than working in isolation. This process continually updates the group’s common knowledge and strengthens its capacity to learn from experience.

**Collective action:** Coordinated efforts by a group to pursue shared interests or solve common problems. Collective action depends on institutions, norms, and trust that make cooperation more attractive than free-riding or withdrawal.

**Collective conscience:** A shared moral framework that underlies laws and norms, expressing what a community currently treats as right, wrong, and worth protecting.[^1_1]

**Collective conscience:** A shared set of beliefs, values, and moral commitments that bind a community together and give legitimacy to its norms and laws.

**Collective security:** A shared sense that members of a community can rely on rules, institutions, and relationships to protect them from harm and arbitrary power.

**Commons governance:** Community-based systems for managing shared resources using local rules, monitoring, and context-sensitive sanctions.[^1_1]

**Commons governance:** Locally grounded systems and rules through which communities manage shared resources, often using norms and sanctions rather than distant state control.

**Complex social system:** An interconnected set of agents, institutions, and feedback loops that shape how socialization unfolds. This system links law, economy, media, education, and family life in ways that can either reinforce or challenge existing cultural patterns.

**Control of disruption:** The ways a society manages harmful or destabilizing behaviours so that daily life stays predictable enough for cooperation and long‑term planning.[^1_1]

**Control of disruptive elements:** A core societal prerequisite involving the management of behaviors and actors seen as threatening stability, order, and collective well-being, using both formal institutions and informal practices.

**Cross-cultural comparison:** By studying diverse societies, anthropologists can identify patterns and variations in role assignment and differentiation.

**Cultural adaptation:** The ways societies adjust beliefs, practices, and institutions in response to environmental, demographic, or political change. Cultural adaptation can reshape power structures and regulatory systems over time.

**Cultural context:** Communication is shaped by local customs, values, and social roles. Shaking hands as greeting in some cultures, bowing in others.

**Cultural ideals:** Widely held visions of how social life ought to be organized—such as justice, harmony, or honour—that inform both informal norms and formal laws.

**Cultural lens on thinking:** The patterned ways of noticing, explaining, and judging that members of a community share, often experienced as “common sense.”

**Cultural models:** Recurrent patterns of shared knowledge and assumptions that organize how a community understands domains like family, illness, time, or authority. These models act as background scripts that guide what seems natural, reasonable, or wrong.

**Cultural patterns:** Repeated ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that characterize a particular group or society. These patterns give social life a recognizable style and continuity across generations.

**Cultural transmission:** The passing of knowledge, beliefs, skills, and practices from one generation to the next. It occurs through families, institutions, media, and everyday interaction.

**Cultural values:** Deeply held collective beliefs about what is good, right, and important that guide judgments about behavior, disruption, and appropriate sanctions.

**Cultural values:** Shared beliefs about justice, harmony, honor, or the common good that guide how societies define disruption and what responses feel fair.[^1_1]

**Cycle of retaliation:** A pattern in which unresolved harms trigger ongoing revenge, vigilantism, or feuds that erode trust and stability.[^1_1]

**Desistance from crime:** The process through which people move away from offending, often supported by predictable, proportionate sanctions and strong social ties.[^1_1]-automation

**Desistance:** The process by which individuals reduce or stop disruptive or criminal behavior, often supported by social bonds, opportunities, and fair forms of control.

**Digital socialization:** The formation of habits, identities, and norms through participation in online platforms and virtual communities. It includes learning how to communicate, present oneself, and interpret others in technologically mediated environments.

**Disruptive elements:** Actions or behaviours that destabilize everyday life, such as violence, theft, corruption, or practices powerful groups label as dangerous.[^1_1]

**Disruptive elements:** Actions, individuals, or groups defined by a community as threatening its norms, safety, or cohesion, a category that shifts across cultures and historical moments.

**Division of labour:** The way tasks and responsibilities are distributed among people according to gender, age, status, skill, or other criteria. It shapes power, dependence, and access to resources.

**Domestic labour:** The work required to maintain a household, including cooking, cleaning, laundry, and routine care tasks. It underpins everyday life but is often invisible in economic accounting.

**Economic inequality:** Uneven distribution of income, wealth, or access to key goods and services across individuals or groups. Redistribution and related policies seek to moderate the most destabilizing forms of inequality.

**Economic leveling:** The reduction of extreme gaps in wealth, income, or life chances through transfers, services, or obligations placed on the better-off. Economic leveling aims to prevent inequalities from undermining stability, health, and democratic participation.

**Egalitarian society:** A social system that minimizes formal hierarchy and resists durable inequalities in power or wealth. Egalitarian societies still contain influence and status differences, but group norms and coalitions prevent individuals from turning influence into domination.

**Enculturation:** The process through which individuals learn the norms, values, symbols, and behaviours of their culture. It begins in early childhood and continues throughout life.

**Endogamy:** A marriage rule requiring partners to marry within a particular social, religious, ethnic, or caste group. It preserves boundaries, status, and shared identity.

**Environmental focus:** Attention to how physical settings and social relationships shape what groups notice, remember, and consider possible. A shared cognitive orientation always develops in response to specific environments, which highlight certain risks, resources, and responsibilities over others.

**Environmental integration:** Using real, tangible locations and physical elements makes movie worlds feel authentic and grounded.

**Everyday coordination:** The ability of people to act together smoothly in routine situations without needing long explanations or detailed negotiation.

**Exogamy:** A marriage rule requiring partners to marry outside a particular group, such as a lineage, clan, or village. It builds alliances and exchange relationships between groups.

**Families:** Social units that organize reproduction, care, and everyday life, usually grounded in kinship or long-term commitment. They function as key sites of child-rearing, support, and cultural transmission.

**Fa’afafine:** A third-gender category in Samoa for people assigned male at birth who embody both masculine and feminine roles. Fa’afafine often play significant roles in household labour, caregiving, and community life.

**Fertility:** The actual reproductive performance of individuals or groups, often measured by the number of children born. It reflects both biological capacity and social, economic, and cultural influences.

**Folk taxonomies:** Local systems for naming and classifying plants, animals, objects, or social roles that reflect practical needs and cultural priorities. They reveal how communities carve up the world in ways that may differ from scientific categories.

**Formal institutions:** Codified organizations and rule systems—such as governments, courts, bureaucracies, and laws—that structure how decisions get made and enforced. Formal institutions stabilize expectations across large populations and long time spans.

**Formal social control:** Codified rules and enforcement systems such as laws, courts, police, and prisons that regulate behavior through official, institutional authority.

**Formal social control:** Codified systems like laws, police, courts, and prisons that use official authority to define and respond to disruption.[^1_1]

**Gender inequalities:** Unequal distribution of resources, power, and recognition between genders. They affect who carries the burden of care, who controls reproductive decisions, and whose labour is valued.

**Gender roles:** The expectations and patterns of behaviour assigned to different genders in a specific cultural context. They organize work, authority, reproduction, and care.

**Gender:** The culturally constructed roles, behaviours, and meanings associated with being male, female, or another gender in a given society. It differs from biological sex and varies across cultures.

**Gift economy:** An economic sphere where goods and services move primarily through giving, obligation, and return rather than explicit pricing. Gift economies often overlap with redistributive systems in feasts, ceremonies, and community support.

**Graduated sanctions:** A stepwise system of consequences that start mild and become stronger only if harmful behaviour continues.[^1_1]

**Graduated sanctions:** A system of escalating responses to rule violations, starting with mild, context-sensitive penalties and increasing in severity for repeated or serious offenses.

**Haptic visuality:** Films engage viewers’ bodily senses by highlighting textures and close-up details, creating a tactile experience that deepens immersion.

**Hidden curriculum:** The implicit lessons schools teach beyond formal subject matter, such as obedience to authority, time discipline, gender expectations, and competitive attitudes. These unspoken lessons shape dispositions and social hierarchies in subtle ways.

**Hijra:** A recognized third-gender community in South Asia whose members often live in distinct social groups and occupy ritual and performance roles. Hijras face both cultural recognition and significant marginalization.

**Holistic approach:** Anthropologists consider how roles interact with other aspects of culture, such as beliefs, values, and social institutions.

**Household pooling:** The sharing of income, goods, and unpaid labor within households or extended families. Household pooling provides everyday mutual aid and often compensates for weak formal redistributive systems.

**Households:** Co-residential groups that share resources, labour, and daily routines, which may or may not coincide with biological families. They provide the practical infrastructure for care and survival.

**Indexicality:** The direct, physical connection between what’s filmed and reality (like light hitting film). “Realness” is mostly how physical the finished image feels.

**Informal control:** Everyday pressures from family, neighbors, peers, and community that shape behaviour through reputation, belonging, and ongoing relationships.[^1_1]

**Informal social control:** Unwritten, community-based processes like gossip, praise, shaming, and social approval or disapproval that regulate behavior through relationships and reputation.

**Institutional breakdown:** A failure of coordination between organizations that occurs when leaders and agencies operate with incompatible assumptions about roles, risks, and responsibilities.

**Interchangeability:** All competent members can both create and understand messages. Any adult can greet another, ask for help, or teach a child.

**Intergenerational transmission:** The specific flow of cultural information and practices from older generations to younger ones, often through family, elders, and educators. It preserves languages, rituals, memories, and skills that anchor collective identity.

**Internalization of norms:** The process through which external rules become part of a person’s own sense of right and wrong, making conformity feel natural or automatic. Internalized norms reduce the need for constant external enforcement and support stable cooperation.

**Internalized norms:** Standards of behaviour that people adopt as part of their identity, so they follow them even without external enforcement.[^1_1]

**Intersectionality:** The interplay of various dimensions of a person’s identity (e.g., gender, ethnicity, class) provides insights into role assignment.

**Justice:** A dynamic, culturally grounded process of defining harm, assigning responsibility, and determining fair responses, rather than a fixed or universal standard.

**Kinship:** Culturally organized relationships based on ideas of blood, marriage, or other forms of relatedness. It structures obligations, inheritance, residence, and belonging.

**Legitimacy of control:** The extent to which people see rules and enforcement as fair, necessary, and aligned with shared values rather than narrow elite interests.[^1_1]

**Legitimacy:** The perception that systems of control, rules, and authorities are appropriate, fair, and morally justified, and therefore deserve compliance.

**Life course socialization:** The recognition that socialization continues across all stages of life, from childhood through old age. Each transition—such as starting school, entering work, forming a family, or retiring—requires new learning and role adjustment.

**Lineage:** A descent-based kin group whose members trace their ancestry to a known or believed common ancestor. Lineages often organize property rights, leadership, and marriage rules.

**Marriage:** A socially recognized union that establishes rights and obligations between partners, their kin, and often their children. It regulates sexuality, reproduction, property, and alliances.

**Melanesian “big man” system:** A leadership pattern in parts of Melanesia where influential figures gain prestige by gathering contributions and staging large redistributive feasts such as moka. Big men rely on persuasion and generosity rather than formal coercive power.

**Modern welfare state:** A set of government institutions that collect taxes and social contributions, then provide transfers and services such as pensions, healthcare, and unemployment benefits. Welfare states function as large-scale redistributive machines across class and the life course.

**Modes of exchange:** Distinct but overlapping patterns of moving goods and value, commonly including reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange. Societies typically combine multiple modes rather than relying on a single one.

**Moka exchange:** A form of competitive gifting in the Papua New Guinea Highlands where leaders give large pig and goods payments that exceed earlier gifts. Moka builds status, forges alliances, and circulates resources widely.

**Monogamy:** A marriage system in which a person has only one spouse at a time. It is common globally but coexists with other marital forms.

**Mutual aid:** Voluntary, often informal, practices where people support each other through shared resources, labor, or care without profit. Mutual aid networks redistribute risk and resources horizontally rather than through formal hierarchies.

**Muxes:** A gender-diverse category in Zapotec communities of southern Mexico, often assigned male at birth but living in roles associated with femininity or a distinct third gender. Muxes commonly engage in care, ritual, and community activities.

**Māhū:** A traditional third-gender role in Hawai‘i and parts of Polynesia for people understood to embody both feminine and masculine spirit. Māhū historically participated in teaching, ritual, and caregiving.

**Norms:** Shared rules or expectations that guide behavior in specific situations, defining what counts as acceptable, appropriate, or unacceptable conduct. Norms help coordinate interaction and reduce uncertainty in everyday life.

**Order:** A recognizable pattern of predictable, rule-governed social life that enables cooperation, trust, and long-term planning.

**Peer groups:** Informal collectives of friends, classmates, teammates, or online companions who share similar age or status. Peer groups act as laboratories of identity where individuals experiment with styles, beliefs, and behaviors, often beyond direct adult control.

**Peer pressure:** The influence exerted by friends, family, and networks that encourages conformity to group norms, often through the desire for acceptance or fear of exclusion.

**Peer pressure:** The influence of friends, family, and community members that nudges people to match group behaviour, either discouraging or amplifying disruption.[^1_1]

**Perceptual realism:** When a film’s visuals feel three-dimensional and lifelike, often achieved through deep focus and detailed environments that let viewers explore the scene naturally.

**Planetary boundaries:** Scientifically defined limits for key Earth system processes—such as climate, biodiversity, and freshwater—that together outline a “safe operating space” for humanity. Remaining within these limits reduces the risk of abrupt or irreversible environmental changes that could undermine societal stability.

**Planetary thresholds:** Critical points along environmental trends where gradual pressures can trigger large, often non-linear shifts in climate or ecosystems. Crossing these thresholds can lock societies into new, less habitable conditions, so TLAV treats them as warning lines for how far systems can be pushed before fundamental change occurs.

**Polarized information:** A condition where groups interpret the same events or data in sharply different ways, increasing social division instead of building agreement.

**Political alliances:** Relationships between groups or families formed to achieve mutual benefits such as security, influence, or economic gain. Marriage and kinship often formalize and sustain these alliances.

**Political power:** The capacity to influence decisions, allocate resources, and shape rules within a community or state. Control over redistributive channels often increases political power and can legitimize or delegitimize authority.

**Polygamy:** A marriage system in which a person has more than one spouse at the same time. It includes polygyny, polyandry, and more flexible plural arrangements.

**Polygyny:** A form of polygamy in which one man is married to multiple women at the same time. It often relates to status, wealth, or labour needs.

**Pooling of resources:** The accumulation of goods, wealth, or labor in a common fund or store controlled on behalf of a group. Pooling transforms individual contributions into collective capacity to manage risk and invest in shared goods.

**Potlatch system:** A ceremonial complex of the Northwest Coast Indigenous peoples in which hosts accumulate goods and then dramatically give them away or destroy them. Potlatch events redistribute wealth, affirm rank, and renew alliances.

**Power dynamics:** Role assignment and differentiation relate to social hierarchies and power structures.

**Power structures:** The patterned ways authority, influence, and decision-making concentrate and circulate in a society. Power structures range from diffuse, consensus-based leadership in small groups to highly centralized institutions in complex states.

**Productivity & recursion:** The system allows endless new expressions and adaptation to novel situations. For example, co-inventing new slang or technical jargon, creative storytelling.

**Prosperity gospel economies:** Religious-economic systems, often within neo-Pentecostal movements, that link faith and giving to expectations of material blessing. These systems reshape how redistribution, risk, and hope operate in conditions of inequality and insecurity.

**Provisioning systems:** The networks, institutions, and technologies that deliver goods and services such as food, transport, housing, and energy. They link social organization with patterns of resource use, and they succeed when they meet human needs while staying within ecological limits and maintaining social cohesion.

**Public services:** Collective goods and infrastructures such as education, healthcare, transport, and social care funded through pooled resources. Public services redistribute both material support and opportunities.

**Racial inequalities:** Structured advantages and disadvantages that follow racial or ethnic lines. They shape health risks, access to care, and treatment in reproductive and family-making institutions.

**Reciprocity:** A pattern of exchange based on giving and receiving between specific partners over time. Reciprocity can shade into redistribution when many reciprocities become organized around a central figure or institution.

**Redistribution process:** The organized dispersal of pooled resources back to group members according to social rules and priorities. This process often expresses ideas about fairness, belonging, and leadership.

**Redistribution:** A system of economic exchange in which goods, wealth, or labor flow to a central authority and then return to the wider group through organized reallocation. It differs from simple reciprocity and market exchange by emphasizing pooling, leadership, and collective security.

**Reinforcement mechanisms:** Systems of rewards and sanctions that encourage adherence to norms and discourage violations. These mechanisms can include everything from social approval and status to fines, exclusion, or imprisonment.

**Religious redistribution:** The collection and reallocation of resources through religious institutions via tithes, offerings, alms, and charitable funds. Religious redistribution can supplement or substitute for state and market safety nets.

**Reproductive inequalities:** Unequal access to reproductive health services, safe childbirth, contraception, and assisted reproduction, often shaped by class, race, gender, and legal status. These inequalities affect who can have children safely and under what conditions.

**Reproductive practices:** The behaviours, norms, and technologies through which people manage fertility, conception, birth, and parenting. They link intimate decisions to broader social, economic, and political structures.

**Reputation:** A socially constructed assessment of a person’s reliability and moral standing that shapes access to trust, cooperation, and informal support.

**Resocialization:** The process of unlearning and relearning norms, values, and behaviors when previous patterns no longer fit new social conditions or roles. It often occurs during major life changes, institutionalization, migration, or occupational retraining.

**Resource management:** The deliberate coordination of production, storage, and distribution to handle scarcity, surplus, and ecological variability. Redistribution contributes to resource management by moving goods across time, regions, or groups in response to changing conditions.

**Restorative justice:** An approach that treats harm as damage to relationships and focuses on repair, apology, and reintegration rather than only punishment.[^1_1]

**Restorative justice:** An approach to addressing harm that prioritizes dialogue, accountability, and repair of relationships among victims, offenders, and the wider community.

**Reverse dominance hierarchy:** A form of political organization where the many consciously unite to prevent any single person from becoming a dominating leader. This pattern uses ridicule, refusal, and collective sanctions to keep authority accountable and relational.

**Semanticity & pragmatics:** Signs, words, or actions carry culturally specific meanings and serve practical purposes. Silence as respect, disagreement, or discomfort varies by culture.

**Semiformal control:** Community-based mechanisms such as neighborhood committees or resident associations that blend state authority with grassroots participation.[^1_1]

**Semiformal social control:** Hybrid mechanisms such as neighborhood committees or resident associations that blend state oversight with grassroots participation in managing order.

**Shared cognition:** Overlapping mental processes that arise when group members coordinate attention, reasoning, and memory around common tasks or goals. It allows groups to interpret information similarly enough to make fast, coherent decisions.

**Shared mental map:** A common internal picture of a situation that allows a group to recognize the same problem and its basic features.

**Shared theories:** Deep, often unspoken belief structures that a group holds about how the world works, including norms, values, identities, and causal assumptions. These theories guide what counts as a good explanation, a fair decision, or a meaningful outcome in collective life.

**Situational awareness:** The shared understanding a group holds about what is happening, what may happen next, and how roles and tasks fit together. High situational awareness lets teams coordinate rapidly under changing conditions because members track the same evolving mental picture.

**Social cohesion:** The degree of solidarity, trust, and connectedness within a society or community. It relies on shared norms, mutual support, and fair access to institutions.

**Social control:** Processes through which a society regulates individual and group behavior to maintain order, predictability, and shared norms. Social control includes both formal tools like law and policing and informal tools like gossip, shame, and praise.

**Social control:** The informal ways communities enforce norms and expectations—through praise, gossip, ridicule, shunning, and everyday interventions—alongside formal rules.[^1_1]

**Social expectations:** Unwritten rules about acceptable behaviour that people internalize so deeply that alternatives often feel unthinkable.[^1_1]

**Social expectations:** Unwritten rules about how one should behave in different contexts, learned through socialization and backed by the threat of social sanction.

**Social identity:** A person’s sense of who they are that arises from membership in groups such as families, ethnic communities, professions, or subcultures. Socialization helps define these memberships and the meanings attached to them.

**Social integration:** The knitting together of individuals and groups into a shared social order through common institutions, obligations, and benefits. Redistribution supports social integration by turning material flows into visible symbols of mutual commitment.

**Social norms:** Shared expectations about appropriate behavior that guide how members of a group act, speak, and relate to one another. Norms can be formal and written or informal and unwritten, but in every case they help coordinate action and express moral boundaries.

**Social parenthood:** The status of being recognized as a parent through care, co-residence, or social roles rather than solely through genetic ties. It highlights that parenting emerges from practice and relationship, not only biology.

**Social roles:** Bundles of expectations, responsibilities, and behaviors attached to particular positions such as student, worker, parent, or neighbor. Socialization teaches individuals how to inhabit these roles in ways that others recognize as legitimate.

**Social sanction:** Any social response—approval, disapproval, reward, or punishment—that encourages conformity to norms or signals violation.

**Social stability:** The relative predictability and coherence of social life that allows people and institutions to function over time. It depends on shared norms, reliable roles, and mechanisms for managing conflict and change.

**Socialization:** The ongoing process through which individuals learn to function as members of society. It transforms biological beings into social persons who understand roles, expectations, and institutions.

**State overreach:** Situations where authorities use excessive or arbitrary control, undermining legitimacy and generating fear instead of genuine order.[^1_1]

**Status and prestige:** Social recognition and honor granted to individuals or institutions that successfully mobilize, manage, and redistribute resources. In many systems, generosity and visible giving underpin status more than simple accumulation.

**Symbolic interpretation:** Roles are often imbued with cultural meanings and symbols, which anthropologists seek to understand.

**System of socialization:** The interconnected network of relationships, institutions, and practices that collectively shape how individuals learn to function within their social world. It coordinates multiple agents and contexts to sustain social order and shared meaning over time.

**Taxation:** The compulsory collection of money or resources by the state from individuals and organizations under legal rules. Taxes finance the pooled funds that enable public services and income transfers.

**Third gender:** A socially recognized gender category that is distinct from male and female. It often carries specific social roles, identities, and forms of participation in reproduction and care.

**TLAV:** TLAV (Thinking Like A Village) is a blog project that explores what it takes for societies to function over the long term, drawing on anthropology, ecology, and community practice. It examines how cultures, institutions, and local histories shape collective responses to environmental and social pressures.

**Traditions:** Practices, stories, and rituals passed down over time that connect present communities to their histories. They help establish continuity and shared identity.

**Values:** Deeply held beliefs about what is good, important, or desirable that guide judgments and choices. Values provide the moral and emotional foundation for norms and institutions in a society.

**Vigilantism:** Informal, often unauthorized use of coercion or violence by non-state actors who claim to enforce order in the absence or failure of legitimate institutions.

**Village Mindset:** A way of thinking that centers interdependence, care, and shared responsibility.
