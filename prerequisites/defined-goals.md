## 7. Defined Goals

Culturally defined goals reflect the values, aspirations, and ideals that a society deems important. They shape the objectives its members are expected to pursue and are deeply embedded in the social fabric. They vary across cultures, influenced by history, environment, beliefs, and collective experiences, and often guide decision-making processes and life choices.

Marked by benchmarks such as financial prosperity, educational achievement, social status, or life milestones, these goals serve as standards for individual and collective behavior.

When individuals struggle to achieve these goals through socially acceptable means, it can create strain and prompt adaptation, including conformity, innovation, or rejection of established expectations.
