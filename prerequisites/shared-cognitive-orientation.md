## 6. Shared Cognitive Orientation

Shared cognitive orientation refers to the collective mental frameworks and shared understandings that emerge within a group. It shapes how members perceive, interpret, and navigate the world, and is deeply influenced by social contexts.

### Key Aspects

- Shared theories: Perceptual beliefs shared by group members, including shared norms, assumptions, and values.
- Environmental focus: Emphasizing the importance of both physical and social contexts.
- Collaborative problem-solving: Building and maintaining a shared conception of a problem.
- Situational awareness: Encompassing shared mental models related to teamwork and taskwork.
