## 4. Shared System of Communication

A shared system of communication is integral to the formation and maintenance of social relationships and cultural identity. A fundamental aspect of human culture is the ability for transmission and interpretation of meaning within a social group.

This system encompasses various modes of communication: verbal, non-verbal, and symbolic forms, which are culturally constructed and transmitted. Disciplines such as communication anthropology examine these within their social and cultural contexts. It considers the cultural metaphors, values, and practices that influence communication, as well as the impact of communication on social structures and relationships.

### Key Factors Informing Our Understanding of Shared Systems of Communication

- Cultural context: The shared system of communication is deeply embedded in cultural norms, values, and social structures.
- Semanticity and pragmatic function: Signs and symbols within the system carry specific meanings for users.
- Interchangeability: Members of the community can both send and receive messages.
- Cultural transmission: Humans learn aspects of the communication system through interaction with others.
- Productivity and recursiveness: The system allows for the creation of an infinite number of messages about any subject.

Different cultures may have distinct patterns of communication, including varying norms for speech and silence, unique symbolic systems and cultural narratives, and specific rules for communicative competence within the community.
